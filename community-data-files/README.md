Community Data Files
====================


This project is a collection of OpenERP modules containing various data files
that are too big to fit the official addons or the other Community projects.

Such data files may include for example tax tables, lists of ZIP codes,
official activity nomenclatures...

This project is the continuation of OpenERP-Nomenclatures, which had a narrower
scope limited to only official files provided by government agencies.
